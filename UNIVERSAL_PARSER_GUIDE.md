## Advanced Features

### Smart Context Analysis
The parser uses context clues to improve accuracy:
- **Proximity analysis**: Fields near each other are likely related
- **Pattern validation**: Cross-validates extracted data
- **Semantic understanding**: Recognizes field types by content
- **Relationship mapping**: Connects related information across lines

### Confidence Scoring
Each parsed record receives a confidence score (0-100%):
- **90-100%**: High confidence, all required fields found with validation
- **75-89%**: Good confidence, most fields found with minor issues
- **60-74%**: Medium confidence, basic fields found but some missing
- **Below 60%**: Low confidence, significant data missing or questionable

### Error Recovery
- **Partial data acceptance**: Uses available data even if incomplete
- **Smart defaults**: Provides reasonable fallbacks for missing fields
- **Validation and correction**: Fixes common formatting issues
- **Multiple parsing attempts**: Tries different strategies if initial parsing fails

### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient pattern matching**: Optimized regex patterns
- **Early termination**: Stops processing when sufficient data found
- **Batch processing**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Memory management**: Processes data in chunks for large files
